**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

My domain for the Capstone project is climate modeling, and this quarter, we are primarily focused on replicating climate model emulators. Before engaging in data processing or modeling tasks, we were first required to read about current climate issues as detailed in the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report. I learned that climate change affects different regions in varying ways, with some regions and populations being disproportionately impacted. Throughout the quarter, we have also been discussing global climate change patterns identified through data analysis. The unequal impact on certain regions became evident from the maps we plotted. These discoveries have further piqued my interest in examining the regional impacts of climate change in greater detail.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

As mentioned above, I would like to potentially investigate the regional impacts of climate change in greater detail for my Quarter 2 project. My teammates have also expressed significant interest in this topic. Specifically, we aim to select a region of interest and develop a model to predict natural disasters based on certain climate variables. This region does not need to be the "most impacted" area on Earth but could instead be a region that is often overlooked and therefore underexamined.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

My Quarter 1 project involves replicating a baseline climate model emulator proposed by my mentor in his preliminary paper on the ClimateBench project. Our current approach is to review the code provided in the ClimateBench GitHub repository for a specific model and adapt it to run in our environment by making small fixes. While we spent a couple of weeks on data processing, the training and testing data for the emulator were ultimately processed by others and provided directly to us. We did not use the data we processed ourselves because the locally available data was incomplete. If given more time, one change I would make to our approach this quarter would be to utilize data processed by myself. This could potentially involve pulling data from the server and then processing it.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
